title: Reduction Between NPCs
---

NPC is short for NP-complete problems, it is a class of decision problems. A decision problem $$$L$$$ is NP-complete if it is in the set of NP problems and also in the set of NP-hard problems. An NP problem is NP-complete if all other NP problems can reduced to it. Below is the reduction relations between NP-complete problems.

## SAT to 3SAT
Given an instance $$$I$$$ of SAT, replace any clause with more 3 literals, such as $$$(a_1 \\vee a_2 \\vee … \\vee a_k)$$$ where $$$k > 3$$$, with a set of clauses
$$(a_1 \\vee a_2 \\vee y_1)(\\overline y_1 \\vee a_3 \\vee y_2) … (\\overline y_{k-3} \\vee a_k-1 \\vee a_k)$$

where the $$$y_i$$$ are new variables. The result is a 3SAT instance $$$I'$$$. The conversion from $$$I$$$ to $$$I'$$$ is clearly polynomial time.


## 3SAT to Independent Set
The input of Independent Set is a graph $$$G$$$ and a number $$$g$$$, the problem is to find a set of $$$g$$$ pairwise non-adjacent vertices.

Given an instance $$$I$$$ of 3SAT, create an instance $$$(G, g)$$$ of Independent Set as follows,
1. Graph G has a triangle(edge or vertex) for each clause, with vertices labeled by the clause's literals
2. Add edge between any two vertices that represent opposite literals.
3. The goal $$$g$$$  is set to the number of clauses.

The graph below corresponding to $$$(\\overline x \\vee y \\vee \\overline z)(x \\vee \\overline y \\vee z)(x \\vee y \\vee z)(\\overline x \\vee \\overline y)$$$

## Independent Set to Vertex Cover
This reduction is very easy, we just need to notice that a set of nodes $$$S$$$ is a vertex cover of graph $$$G=(V, E)$$$ if and only if the remaining nodes, $$$V-S$$$ are an independent set of $$$G$$$.

Given an instance $$$(G, g)$$$ of Independent Set, simply look for a vertex cover of $$$G$$$ with $$$|V|-g$$$ nodes. If there is a solution to vertex cover, then there is a solution to Independent Set. 

## Independent Set to Clique
The input of Clique is a graph $$$G$$$ and a number $$$g$$$, the problem is to find a $$$g$$$ vertices such that all possible edges between them are present.

This reduction is also very easy. Define the **complement** of a graph $$$G=(V,E)$$$ to be $$$\\overline G=(V, \\overline E)$$$, where $$$\\overline E$$$ contains precisely those unordered pairs of vertices that are not in $$$E$$$. Then a set of nodes $$$S$$$ is an Independent Set of $$$G$$$ if and only if $$$S$$$ is a clique of $$$\\overline G$$$.

Given an instance $$$(G,g)$$$ of Independent Set, simply mapping it to the corresponding instance $$$(\\overline G, g)$$$ of Clique, and the solution to both is identical.
