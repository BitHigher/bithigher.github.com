**To Be Continued**

NPC is short for NP-complete problems, it is a class of decision problems. A decision problem $$$L$$$ is NP-complete if it is in the set of NP problems and also in the set of NP-hard problems.

An NP problem is NP-complete if all other NP problems can reduced to it. Below is the reduction relations between NP-complete problems.

## SAT to 3SAT
Given an instance $$$I$$$ of SAT, replace any clause with more 3 literals, such as $$$(a_1 \\vee a_2 \\vee … \\vee a_k)$$$ where $$$k > 3$$$, with a set of clauses
$$(a_1 \\vee a_2 \\vee y_1)(\\overline y_1 \\vee a_3 \\vee y_2) … (\\overline y_{k-3} \\vee a_k-1 \\vee a_k)$$

where the $$$y_i$$$ are new variables. The result is a 3SAT instance $$$I'$$$. The conversion from $$$I$$$ to $$$I'$$$ is clearly polynomial time.


## 3SAT to Independent Set
The input of Independent Set is a graph $$$G$$$ and a number $$$g$$$, the problem is to find a set of $$$g$$$ pairwise non-adjacent vertices.

Given an instance $$$I$$$ of 3SAT, create an instance $$$(G, g)$$$ of Independent Set as follows,

1. Graph G has a triangle(edge or vertex) for each clause, with vertices labeled by the clause's literals
2. Add edge between any two vertices that represent opposite literals.
3. The goal $$$g$$$  is set to the number of clauses.

The graph below corresponding to $$$(\\overline x \\vee y \\vee \\overline z)(x \\vee \\overline y \\vee z)(x \\vee y \\vee z)(\\overline x \\vee \\overline y)$$$

## Independent Set to Vertex Cover
This reduction is very easy, we just need to notice that a set of nodes $$$S$$$ is a vertex cover of graph $$$G=(V, E)$$$ if and only if the remaining nodes, $$$V-S$$$ are an independent set of $$$G$$$.

Given an instance $$$(G, g)$$$ of Independent Set, simply look for a vertex cover of $$$G$$$ with $$$|V|-g$$$ nodes. If there is a solution to vertex cover, then there is a solution to Independent Set. 

## Independent Set to Clique
The input of Clique is a graph $$$G$$$ and a number $$$g$$$, the problem is to find a $$$g$$$ vertices such that all possible edges between them are present.

This reduction is also very easy. Define the **complement** of a graph $$$G=(V,E)$$$ to be $$$\\overline G=(V, \\overline E)$$$, where $$$\\overline E$$$ contains precisely those unordered pairs of vertices that are not in $$$E$$$. Then a set of nodes $$$S$$$ is an Independent Set of $$$G$$$ if and only if $$$S$$$ is a clique of $$$\\overline G$$$.

Given an instance $$$(G,g)$$$ of Independent Set, simply mapping it to the corresponding instance $$$(\\overline G, g)$$$ of Clique, and the solution to both is identical.

## 3SAT to 3D Matching
In graph theory, a matching or independent edge set in a graph is a set of edges without common vertices. 3D matching is a generalization of matching to 3-uniform hypergraphs. Let $$$X$$$, $$$Y$$$, $$$Z$$$ be finite, disjoint sets, and let $$$T$$$ be a subset of $$$X \\times Y \\times Z$$$. That is $$$T$$$ consists of triples$$$(x, y, z)$$$ such that $$$ x \\in X, y \\in Y, z \\in Z$$$. Now $$$ M \\subset T $$$ is a 3D matching if the following holds: for any two disjoint triples $$$(x_1, y_1, z_1) \\in M$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2, z_2) \\in M$$$, we have $$$x_1 \\neq x_2, y_1 \\neq y_2, z_1 \\neq z_2$$$.

## 3D Matching to ZOE

## ZOE to Subset Sum
Both of these problems are special cases of ILP, one with many equations but only 0-1 coefficients, and the other with a single equation but arbitrary integer coefficients.

For example, given an instance of ZOE:

![ZOE](http://i44.tinypic.com/15re9gz.png)

we are looking for a set of columns of $$$A$$$ that, added together, make up the all-1's vector. But if we think of the columns as binary integers(read from top to bottom), we are look for a subset of the integers $$$ \\{18, 5, 4, 8 \\}$$$ that add up to the binary integer $$$11111_2 = 31$$$. And this is an instance of **Subset Sum**.

To avoid the problem of *carry*, that caused by adding binary integers, we can think of each column as an integer in base *n+1*, this way, since at most *n* integers are added, add all their digits are 0 and 1, there won't be any carry.

## ZOE to ILP
ZOE is a special case of ILP, but it still takes a little work to reduce ZOE to ILP. In ILP, we are looking for an integer vector $$$x$$$ taft satisfies $$$Ax \\leq b $$$, for given matrix $$$A$$$ and vector $$$b$$$. To write an instance of **ZOE** in this precise form, there are two steps,

1. for $$$Ax = 1$$$ in ZOE, we rewrite it to $$$Ax \\leq 1$$$ and $$$-Ax \\leq -1$$$.
2. for each $$$x_i$$$, we rewrite it to $$$x_i \\leq 1$$$ and $$$-x_i \\leq 0$$$.

After these two steps, we get an instance of **ILP**.

## ZOE to Rudrata Cycle

## Rudrata Cycle to TSP
These two problems are similar to each other, and the reduction is no so hard, given an instance $$$G=(V,E)$$$ of Rudrata Cycle, convert it to an instance of TSP as below,

1. The set of cities is the same as $$$V$$$.
2. The distance between cities $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ is 1 if $$$\\{u,v\\}$$$ is an edge of $$$G$$$ and 2 otherwise. 
3. The budget of TSP instance is equal to the number of nodes, $$$|V|$$$.

If there is a tour within the budget of the **TSP** instance, then the tour is a **Rudrata Cycle** in $$$G$$$. 

## Rudrata Path to Rudrata Cycle
Given an instance $$$(G=(V,E), s, t)$$$ of **Rudrata Path**, just add a node $$$x$$$ to $$$V$$$, and $$$\\{s,x\\}, \\{t,x\\}$$$ to $$$E$$$ to construct an instance $$$G'=(V', E')$$$ of **Rudrata Cycle**.

If there a rudrata cycle in $$$G'$$$, then the cycle must include $$$\\{s,x\\}, \\{t,x\\}$$$, just by removing these two edges we can get a rudrata path.
