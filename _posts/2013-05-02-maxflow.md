In optimization theory, the max-flow min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the minimum cut of the same network. The max-flow min-cut theorem is a special case of the *duality theorem* for *linear programs*.

## Maximum Flow Problem
In graph theory, a flow network(also known as transportation network) is a **directed graph** where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. In the flow network below, donation **f/c** on each edge means that the capacity of that edge is **c**, and the flow on that edge is **f**.

The maximum flow problem involves finding a feasible flow through a **single-source**, **single-sink** flow network that is maximum. In the above graph, **s** is the source, and **t** is the sink.

Let $$$N=(V,E)$$$ be a network(directed graph) with $$$s, t$$$ being the source and sink of $$$N$$$ respectively. The capacity of an edge is a mapping $$$ c:E \\rightarrow R\^+ $$$, denoted by $$$c(u,v)$$$. A flow is a mapping $$$ f: E \\rightarrow R\^+ $$$, denoted by $$$f(u,v)$$$, subject to the following two constraints:

1. $$$f(u,v) \\leq c(u,v)$$$ for each $$$(u,v) \\in E$$$ (capacity constraint)
2. $$$\\sum f(u,v) = \\sum f(v,u)$$$ for each $$$v \\in V \\setminus \\{s,t\\}$$$ (conservation of flows)

The value of flow is denoted by $$$|f| = \\sum f(s,v)$$$, where $$$s$$$ is the source of $$$N$$$. It represents the amount of flow passing from the source to the sink.

## Minimum Cut Problem
In graph theory, a cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets, the *cut* here means the set of edges whose end points are in different subsets of the partition. Edges are said to be *crossing* the cut if they are in its cut-set.

A minimum cut of a graph is a cut whose cut-set has the smallest number of elements(undirected case) or smallest  sum of weights possible.
