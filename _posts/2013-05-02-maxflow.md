In optimization theory, the max-flow min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the minimum cut of the same network.

## Maximum Flow Problem
In graph theory, a flow network(also known as transportation network) is a **directed graph** where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge. In the flow network below, donation **f/c** on each edge means that the capacity of that edge is **c**, and the flow on that edge is **f**.

The maximum flow problem involves finding a feasible flow through a **single-source**, **single-sink** flow network that is maximum.


## Minimum Cut Problem
In graph theory, a cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets, the *cut* here means the set of edges whose end points are in different subsets of the partition. Edges are said to be *crossing* the cut if they are in its cut-set.

A minimum cut of a graph is a cut whose cut-set has the smallest number of elements(undirected case) or smallest  sum of weights possible.
