What is sigmoid? what is sigmoid CPD? why can it reduce parameters? and why can it capture relations between variables?

## What is Sigmoid

Actually, *Sigmoid* is a function with name *sigmoid function*. It's a mathematical function having an **S** shape (sigmoid curve). Often, sigmoid function refers to the special case of *logistic function* shown below and defined by the formula

$$ S(x) = \\frac{e^x}{1+e^x} $$

or

$$ S(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$

## What is Sigmoid CPD

Sigmoid CPD is an variant of linear CPD, it just applies a sigmoid function on the linear result. And the parameters in Sigmoid CPD are just the weights in the linear relationship. For distribution $$$P(X_1, X_2,…, X_n)$$$ , the linear CPD is

$$$ P_L(X_1, X_2, …, X_n) = w_0 + \\sum_i^n w_i X_i $$$, where $$$w_i$$$ is the weight of each variable, and $$$w_0$$$ is the bias.

so the sigmoid CPD is

$$$ P_S(X_1, X_2, … X_n) = \\frac {1}{1+e^{-P_L(X_1, X_2, …, X_n)}}$$$

Compared with traditional CPD, whose number of parameters is proportional to $$$ \\prod_i^n d_i $$$ ($$$n$$$ is the number of variables and $$$d_i$$$ is the cardinality of the i-th variable), the number of parameters in Sigmoid CPD is reduced to $$$n$$$.
