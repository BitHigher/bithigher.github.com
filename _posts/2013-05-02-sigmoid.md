What is sigmoid? what is sigmoid CPD? why can it reduce parameters? and why can it capture relations between variables?

## What is Sigmoid

Actually, *Sigmoid* is a function with name sigmoid function. It's a mathematical function having an **S** shape (sigmoid curve). Often, sigmoid function refers to the special case of *logistic function* shown below and defined by the formula

$$ S(x) = \\frac{e^x}{1+e^x} $$

or

$$ S(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$
