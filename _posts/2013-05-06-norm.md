In mathematics, a *norm* is a function that assigns a strictly positive length or size to each vector in a vector space, other than the zero vector. A *seminorm*, on the other hand, is allowed to assign zero length to some non-zero vectors(in addition to the zero vector). Norm may come in many forms and many names, including these popular names: Euclidean distance, Mean-squared Error, etc. Usually, norm appears in this form:
$$\\| x \\|$$
where $$$x$$$ is a vector or matrix, for example, a Euclidean norm of a vector $$$a = [1, 2, 3]^T$$$ is:
$$ \\| a \\|_2 = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2} $$


## L0-norm

$$\\| x \\|_0 = \\sum x_i^0$$
That is the number of non-zero elements.

## L1-norm

$$\\| x \\|_1 = \\sum |x_i| $$
That is the sum of each element's absolute value.

## L2-norm

## Linfinity-norm

For $$$p \\geq 1$$$, 
$$\\| x \\|_p = (\\sum |x_i|^p)^{\\frac{1}{p}}$$
