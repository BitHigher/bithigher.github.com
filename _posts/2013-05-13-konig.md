In the mathematical area of graph theory, Konig's theorem describes an equivalence between the *maximum matching* problem and the *minimum vertex cover* problem in *bipartite graphs*.

> **Konig's theorem**
>
> Given a bipartite graph $$$G=(V,E)$$$: min |C|  = max |M|

## Proof

We can break the proof into two steps. Firstly, we can prove that |C| $$$ \\ge $$$ |M|, and secondly, we prove that  min|C| $$$ \le $$$ max|M|, then `Konig's theorem` gets proved.

**First Step**

>It is very easy to prove that |C| $$$ \\ge $$$ |M| for any vertex cover an matching in the same bipartite graph. Because each edge of the matching must be covered by the vertex cover, so at least one vertex of each edge must in the set of vertex cover, thus we proved that |C| $$$ \\ge $$$ |M| at any circumstance.

**Second Step**
