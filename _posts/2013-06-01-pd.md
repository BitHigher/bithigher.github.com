It can be classified into two categories, namely *Discrete Probability Distribution* and *Continuous Probability Distribution*.

## Discrete Probability Distribution
In Discrete Probability Distribution, the random variable can only be assigned with a discrete value which is finite or countable, common discrete probability distributions are:

### Discrete uniform distribtuion

$$ p(k \\mid m, n) = \\frac{1}{n-m-1}$$


### Bernoulli distribution

$$ p(1 \\mid p) = p $$

### Binomial distribution

$$ p(k \\mid n, p) = (^n_k)p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$

### Multinomial distribution

$$ p(\\vec{x} \\mid n, \\vec{p}) = \\frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!...x_k!} p_1^{x_1}p_2^{x_2}â€¦p_k^{x_k} $$

### Geometric distribution

### Hypergeometric distribution

### Poisson distribution



## Continuous Probability Distribution
