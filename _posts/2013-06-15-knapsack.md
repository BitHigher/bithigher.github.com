Knapsack is a very classic problem of dynamic programming. The most common case of Knapsack is 0-1 Knapsack without repetition. It defines as:

> Let $$$ U = \\{u_1, u_2, …, u_n\\}$$$ be a set of items to be packed in a knapsack of size $$$C$$$. For $$$ 1 \\leq j \\leq n$$$, let $$$ s_j $$$ and $$$ v_j $$$ be the size and value of the j-th item.

> Problem: We want to find a subset of $$$ S \\subseteq U $$$ such that  
> $$ \\sum\_{u_j \\in S} v_j $$  
> is maximized subject to the constraint  
> $$ \\sum\_{u_j \\in S} s_j \\leq C $$

Let V\[i, j\] be the value obtained by fill ing a knapsack of size j with items from the first i items $$$\\{u_1, u_2, …, u_i\\}$$$ in an optimal way.

The recurrence relation

$$ V\[i,j\] = \left\\{ \begin{array}{11}
0 & \mbox{if $i=0$ or $j=0$}  \\\
V\[i-1,j\] & \mbox{if $j \lt s_i$ } \\\
max\\{V\[i-1, j\], V\[i-1, j-s_i\] + v_i\\} & \mbox{if $j \geq s_i$}
\end{array} \right. $$
